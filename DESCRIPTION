Description: GetNC (Gaussian Experiment Testing and Knockout Calculator) is an 
    R package for modeling and validating gene regulatory relationships using 
    multivariate Gaussian inference. It fits sparse Gaussian graphical models 
    from single-cell expression data, predicts combinational knockout outcomes 
    via closed-form conditional Gaussian formulas, and validates model 
    reliability against observed perturbation experiments. GetNC bridges the 
    gap between network inference and biological validation — providing a 
    mathematically interpretable, simulation-free method to predict and assess 
    perturbation effects directly from fitted graphical models.
