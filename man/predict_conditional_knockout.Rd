\title{Conditional prediction for combinational knockouts}
\usage{
predict_conditional_knockout(fit, target, knocked, mu = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{fit}{list returned by \code{fit_glasso()} or \code{run_glasso_seurat()},
must contain \code{$sigma} and \code{$features}.}

\item{target}{character or integer vector giving the genes to predict.}

\item{knocked}{character or integer vector giving the genes that are set to 0.}

\item{mu}{optional mean vector (same order as \code{fit$features}). If NULL,
0 is assumed for all genes.}
}
\value{
list with \code{mean_cond} and \code{cov_cond}.
}
\description{
This function takes the covariance and feature names from a fitted
Gaussian model (the output of \code{fit_glasso()} or
\code{run_glasso_seurat()}) and computes the conditional mean and
covariance of a set of target genes, given that another set of genes
is forced to 0 (knocked out).
