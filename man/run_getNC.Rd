\title{Launch the getNC Interactive Shiny Application}
\usage{
run_getNC()
}
\value{
Launches the Shiny application and returns the Shiny object created by
\code{shiny::runApp()}. The function is normally called for its side effect
of opening the interactive UI.
}
\description{
This function starts the \strong{getNC} Shiny application, an interactive
graphical tool for exploring Gaussian graphical models (glasso), selecting
gene knockouts directly from a network visualization, and viewing
conditional density plots for predicted perturbation effects.
}
\details{
The app provides:
\itemize{
\item Interactive \strong{GLgraph} visualization with selectable gene knockouts.
\item Automatic processing of raw matrices or Seurat objects.
\item Conditional mean/variance predictions under single or multiple knockouts.
\item Interactive 3D density plots of predicted conditional distributions.
}

By default, the Shiny UI loads using the PBMC example dataset bundled with
the package. Users can optionally upload their own data in CSV or RDS format.

This function locates the Shiny application directory installed with the
\pkg{getNC} package and runs it using \code{shiny::runApp()}. If the app
directory cannot be found (e.g., incomplete installation), an error is thrown.

Typical usage:
\preformatted{
    library(getNC)
    run_getNC()
}

The application runs in the user's default web browser unless otherwise
configured via Shiny options.
