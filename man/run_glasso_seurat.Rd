\title{Run graphical lasso on a Seurat object}
\usage{
run_glasso_seurat(obj, nfeatures = 2000, rho = 0.1)
}
\arguments{
\item{obj}{A Seurat object that has already been normalized
(e.g., via \code{Seurat::NormalizeData()}).}

\item{nfeatures}{Integer. Number of variable features to use (default 2000).}

\item{rho}{Numeric. \eqn{\ell_1} regularization parameter for
\code{glasso::glasso()}.}
}
\value{
A list with components:
\itemize{
\item \code{omega}: estimated precision matrix (inverse covariance) for the selected features.
\item \code{sigma}: estimated covariance matrix for the selected features.
\item \code{mu}: numeric vector of per-gene means (order matches \code{features}).
\item \code{sd}: numeric vector of per-gene standard deviations (order matches \code{features}).
\item \code{features}: character vector of feature (gene) names used.
\item \code{glasso}: the raw \code{glasso} fit object.
}
}
\description{
This wrapper selects variable features, records per-gene mean and standard
deviation from the normalized expression, produces a z-scored matrix for
those features, and fits a sparse Gaussian graphical model via
\code{glasso::glasso()}.
}
\details{
Variable features are selected with \code{Seurat::FindVariableFeatures()}.
Per-gene mean (\code{mu}) and standard deviation (\code{sd}) are computed from the
normalized (unscaled) expression for the selected features. The covariance
matrix used by glasso is computed from the z-scored matrix of those features.
